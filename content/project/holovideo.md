This project, joint work with Dr. Wendy Plesniak, resulted in the very first holographic video system with haptic interaction - enabling a viewer to see a holographic image without any glasses, feel it using a haptic stylus, and sculpt it as if using a lathe. The haptic stylus enabled a realistic physical simulation of using a lathe.
