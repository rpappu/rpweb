My team at ThingMagic did the original R&D in support of [Disney's Magic Band](https://www.wired.com/2015/03/disney-magicband/) project. In the image below, you see one of the very first bands wrapped around a big hunk of bacon (to simulate a human arm) and mounted on a 6-degree-of-freedom RF-friendly gimbal.
