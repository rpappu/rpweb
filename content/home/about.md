## Scientist &#8226; Entrepreneur &#8226; Technology Executive

 I am CTO at [InQTel](http://iqt.org), where I work long-term technology strategy and roadmaps, [https://www.iqt.org/organizing-deep-tech-at-scale/](tools to systematically understand technology innovation), and diligence for deep tech investments Quantum Information Science, AI, IoT, and 5G. I am also a Senior Commercializaton Advisor at [IQT Emerge](https://www.iqt.org/emerge/) where I work with DARPA-funded startups on commercialization strategies. 

Prior to this, as a platform architect at [Trimble Navigation](https://www.trimble.com), I designed, prototyped, and led the implementation of a [high-performance distributed sensing and IoT and analytics](https://www.trimble.com/fsm/index.aspx) platform. I went to Trimble from [ThingMagic](http://meche.mit.edu/news-media/catching-radio-waves), a venture-backed pioneer in the RFID/IoT space that I co-founded. ThingMagic was [acquired by Trimble Navigation](https://www.trimble.com/news/release.aspx?id=102510a).

As a scientist (Ph.D., MIT 2001), I have worked on [original and influential contributions](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=h8YeWokAAAAJ&hl=en) to several fields. I am a science/technology/mathematics omnivore and really enjoy bringing my skills to bear on solving challenging problems at the intersection of science, technology, and product development. I am equally comfortable synthesizing a technology/product vision as I am executing it.

My [Erdos Number](https://oakland.edu/enp/thedata/) is 3. (Paul Erdos &#8594; Leonard Schulman &#8594; Benjamin Recht &#8594; Ravi Pappu)
